# What is it?
OSR Next is a reimagining of the 5th Edition System Reference Document as an OSR compatible system.

Documents are in the docs/ directory.

# Coming Soon
Published as a website built via mkdocs on https://osr-next.com

# FAQ
### What is the OSR?
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_Renaissance) actually has a pretty cool article on it. 

### Why "OSR Next"?
5th Edition's play testing name was "D&D Next", so I thought it sounded nice and was thematic to the goal of this reimagining.
