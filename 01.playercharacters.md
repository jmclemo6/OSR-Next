# Player Characters

## Character Basics

Players play **player characters (PCs)**. 
PCs can be a vicious warrior, a devout acolyte, a sneaky thief, an intelligent mage, or anything in-between.
The group of PCs is a **party**, which may have **non-player characters (NPCs)** as retainers.

PCs have six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
Abilities are listed as a **score** and a **modifier**.

The score defines certain limits (such as the number of retainers a PC can command) and the modifier adjusts checks or other rolls.

**Hit Points (HP)**, equipment, spells, and special techniques (such as class features) further define PCs.
As PCs **gain experience points (XP)**, they **level up**and gain benefits.

# PC Race
PCs are usually human, but may be another race.
Each race has a different way to determine ability scores, class restrictions based on ability scores, and a unique **cultural trait**.
> _Designers Note: Cultural traits are ultimately up to the GM to decide. Example ones will be given below, but a GM is free to create others and modify these examples. GMs may also allow players to choose cultural traits from a race that is not their chosen race. This covers cases where a player wishes to be a member of a race raised in a culture that is not their own._
