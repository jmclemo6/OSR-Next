# Core Mechanic
Any time a character attempts something risky that could go wrong, they must **roll a check** and **let it ride**.

**Roll a check.** Roll 1d20 + modifier and compare against the action’s **Difficulty Class (DC)**. If you have a clear **advantage**, roll 2d20 and keep the better of the two rolls. Likewise, when you’re faced with a clear **disadvantage**, roll 2d20 and keep the worse of the two rolls.

**Let it ride.** Only a single roll is permitted until circumstances change.

## DCs
The DC of a check is determined by the GM and based on the difficulty of the action being performed. You **succeed** if you meet or beat the DC.

The default DC is 11, but the GM is free to use a DC as low as 5 or as high as 20. The GM can choose to forgo a check if the action is impossible or doesn’t have a risk of failure.

## Check Modifiers
A check can have modifiers which can change its outcome by adding or subtracting from the d20 roll.
